# Criminal justice system
developing whole system view of criminal justice system model in the UK to answer policy and other "what if" questions

## Open data access
There are many data sources available from the gov.uk websites but none really provide easy access so part of the project is dedicated to enable easy access to the data with preprocessing to make it suitable for analysis and modeling.

This is set of data we are starting with and we will bring in methods for the ones we need

Criminal justice system overview dashboard has a section on "Improving timeliness" and this is where we are going to get all the avg(median) number of days in different quarters in different regions as people pass through the system.
